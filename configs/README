===================
Boot Configurations
===================

This directory holds the content of the boot configuration for each image
generated by the classic gadget. Each directory is based on the template
"$SERIES-$ARCH-$IMAGETYPE", for example "noble-arm64-desktop".

Each directory holds the files that the gadget should copy (verbatim) to the
boot partition. No interpolation or editing of files is performed, but symlinks
will be converted to regular files (the boot partition is FAT and cannot
support symlinks anyway). This can be used to each maintenance by, for example,
linking equivalent files (like README) to directories in the same series.
